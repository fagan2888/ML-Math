# ML-Math functions

A collection of functions for machine learning math. Most were adapted from Coursera's [Mathmatics for Machine Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning?).

[LAutil.py](LAutil.py) contains functions for linear algebra related to ML. It also contains PageRank implementation.

[Simple-Neural-Net.py](Simple-Neural-Net.py) contains an implementation of a simple neural net.
